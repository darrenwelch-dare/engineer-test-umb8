# Dare - Engineer Test

## Your Challenge
As a candidate, you will have 1 hour to create a ToDo list, that will save the contents of the ToDo list to the database assigned to the logged in member.

You’ll do this with your screen shared with the interviewer, so that all your actions (coding, internet searching etc.) are visible.

Completion of the challenge is not the target

The goals of this exercise are to assess:

- your approach to the task
- your mental model of the technologies involved
- your use of tools and techniques
- We do not expect people to know everything, so looking things up on Google is fine: Google, Stackoverflow, etc. are tools of the trade and we will assess how well you use them.

## Requirements
Using the application it should be possible to:

- Add a new item to a list
- Mark an item as complete
- Mark an item as incomplete
- Add a sub-list to a list item and mark them as complete/incomplete

## Rules
- You may ask for clarification on the requirements and process
- You may use any IDE or developer tools
- You can look things up as much as you want
- You may ask for help if you’re stuck
- You must use React and/or Umbraco to implement the ToDo list on the /to-do/ page. but can use these in any combination (front-end only is fine)
- You should share your thinking as you go

## Credentials
- Username: engineer@test.com
- Password: @G6jUyP2Eh

This website uses a local SQL CE database in the /app_data folder.  The credentials to log into your local database are the same for CMS access and to log in as a Member.

- /umbraco [CMS access]
- /login [Member access]

## Code
You can choose to complete the solution using C# or a combination of C# & React.

The project has been set up with React.  The code can be located in the /frontend folder.

Firstly navigate to the /frontend folder and run the command:

## npm install
to install the dependencies.

To compile your code:
- npm run build

## Completion

Completing the challenge doesn’t mean you get the job. There are many factors that influence a hiring decision and your performance on this
challenge is just one of them. Equally, not completing the challenge doesn’t mean you don’t get the job.

A candidate who approaches the problem well, shows an aptitude for the work and clearly understands what they’re doing but does not finish will be more successful than someone who finishes quickly but has missed some important details.

### Good luck!
